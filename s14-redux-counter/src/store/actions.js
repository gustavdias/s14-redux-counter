//? it is a good practice to outsource your action types into constants you can use in your application so that you always just import a constant and eliminate the danger of mistyping,

export const INCREMENT = "INCREMENT";
export const DECREMENT = "DECREMENT";
export const ADD = "ADD";
export const SUBTRACT = "SUBTRACT";
export const STORE_RESULT = "STORE_RESULT";
export const DELETE_RESULT = "DELETE_RESULT";
